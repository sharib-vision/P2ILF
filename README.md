# Preoperative to Intraoperative Laparoscopy Fusion (P2ILF)

### About
**Augmented reality (AR) in laparoscopic liver surgery** needs key landmark detection in intraoperative 2D laparoscopic images and its registration with the preoperative 3D model created from CT/MRI data. 

### Tasks for assessment

- Task 1: finding reliable landmarks from laparoscopy video images
- Task 2: matching it to the 3D liver model from volumetric data (CT/MR).

### Metrics for evaluation

TODO:
- Anatomical landmark segmentation
- Anatomical landmark localization 
- 2D-3D keypoint matching distance, root mean square error
